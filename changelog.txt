Some examples:

Checking for token completion:

    $tokenLibrary = Gems_Tokens::getLibrary($this->db);
    $tokenLibrary->checkAnswers($data['grs_id_user'], $this->session->user_id);
New:
    $this->loader->getTracker()->processCompletedTokens($data['grs_id_user'], $this->session->user_id);

Getting the survey questions:
Old:
    $source     = Gems_Sources::getBySurveyId($this->gsu_id);
    $this->data = $source->getSurveyQuestions($this->gsu_id, $this->locale);
New:
    $survey = $this->loader->getTracker()->getSurvey($this->gsu_id);
    $this->data = $survey->getQuestionInformation($this->locale->getLanguage());

Getting answers:
Old:
    Gems_Tokens::getAnswers($currentToken['gto_id_token'], $first));
New:
    $token = $this->loader->getTracker()->getToken($currentToken['gto_id_token']);
    $token->getRawAnswers();
or formatted:
    $model = $token->getSurveyAnswerModel($this->locale->getLanguage());
    $model->applyRequest($this->request);
    $model->loadFirst();
    etc...

getting a token model:
Old:
    $this->loader->getModels()->getTokenModel('T' == $this->trackType);
New for generic token model:
    $this->loader->getTracker()->getTokenModel();
Or for token specific detail show & edit:
    $this->loader->getToken('xxxx-xxxx')->getModel();

Getting a respondent model:
